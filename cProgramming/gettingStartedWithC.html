    <p> There are lots of good book on C. Most of them spend a lot of time in the first chapter
      <br> talking about the History of C and the reason you should use it. I will not be doing this
      <br>becuase it is a waste of time. You should just find a good book and skip the first chapter
      <br>and go right into programming in C.</br>

      <br> Here are a few good points worth mentioning about C.</br>

    <p>C is........</p>
    
    <ul>
      <!-- This creates bullet points -->
      <li>Structured</li> 
      
      <!-- Note: this creates a number list bullet points -->
      <ol type="1">
	<li> Has for and while loops</li>
	<li> Block structures (like when you "block" your code in curly braces)</li>
	<li> Subroutines (things that do small tasks like functions or methods)</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      
      <li>Imperative (or procedural)</li>
      <ol type="1">
	<li> Describes the program in terms of statements</li>
	<li> Opposite of "Declarative". Doesn't tell the program what to do, but how to do it</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <li>Useful for system programming</li>
      <ol type="1">
	<li> Low level access to memory</li>
	<li> Communicates directly with machine language (Assembly) and hardware</li>
      </ol>    
    </ul> <!-- end of bullet points -->
